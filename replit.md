# Replit Project Documentation

## Overview

This appears to be a new or empty repository with no existing code structure. The project is ready for initial development and architecture setup.

## System Architecture

Currently, no system architecture is defined. The repository is in its initial state and ready for development decisions to be made based on project requirements.

## Key Components

No components are currently implemented. The following areas will likely need to be defined:

- **Frontend**: Framework and technology stack to be determined
- **Backend**: Server architecture and API design to be established
- **Database**: Data storage solution to be selected
- **Authentication**: User management system to be implemented
- **Deployment**: Infrastructure and deployment strategy to be defined

## Data Flow

No data flow is currently established. This will need to be designed based on the application's requirements and chosen architecture.

## External Dependencies

No external dependencies are currently defined. Common dependencies that may be added include:

- Database drivers (potentially Postgres with Drizzle ORM)
- Authentication libraries
- API frameworks
- Frontend libraries/frameworks
- Testing frameworks
- Build tools

## Deployment Strategy

No deployment strategy is currently defined. This will need to be established based on the chosen technology stack and hosting requirements.

## Development Notes

Since this is a fresh repository, architectural decisions will need to be made for:

1. **Technology Stack Selection**: Choose appropriate frontend and backend technologies
2. **Database Design**: Select and configure database solution (Drizzle ORM may be used, potentially with Postgres)
3. **Project Structure**: Establish folder organization and file naming conventions
4. **Development Workflow**: Set up build processes, testing, and deployment pipelines
5. **Configuration Management**: Establish environment variables and configuration files

The code agent should be prepared to make these foundational decisions based on project requirements and best practices.
